================================
### A tool for developers crazy enough to try and develop web pages and forms that relies on key events and key codes for mobile browsers.

autoKeyTest was created to test mobile browsers support for the key events and key codes. My jQuery plugin "autoNumeric" relies heavily on "keydown", "keypress", "keyup" and "keyCode" to function properly. 

Most android browsers (including Chrome) and Windows Mobile browser do not support all of the events, the order which events fire and or return incorrect key codes for alpha characters that their desktop counterparts do properly, which has cost me countless hours trying to modify my code to compensate for their bugs.
